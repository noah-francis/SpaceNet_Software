## Making .mlapp Changes
1) Make a copy of the latest version of the app
2) Make changes on copied version of the app on separate branch
3) Update version number. First number in version corresponds to a graphical update, second corresponds to a software update.
4) When finished, stage and commit new .mlapp version
5) Then push branch to github with 'git push origin <your_branch_name>'
6) Note: editing a past version or even running will cause merging errors, so make sure to make copies.
